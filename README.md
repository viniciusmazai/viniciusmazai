# Hey, I'm Chester! 👋

Welcome to my humble corner of GitHub. I've been an BIM Specialist and Architecture Technician since 2016, designing buildings, spaces, and probably more Excel sheets than I’d like to admit. But plot twist! I've decided to leave the world of blueprints and bricks behind to embrace the wonderful chaos of programming. 🎉

### 🚀 The Great Career Pivot:
After years of making sure walls stay upright, I realized something—I wanted to break stuff too (digitally, of course). So now, I’m diving headfirst into **The Odin Project**, where I’m learning to code with the ultimate goal of becoming a *Ruby on Rails* developer. Because, honestly, why not swap the headaches of zoning regulations for the joys of debugging?

### 🛠️ Skills? Oh, They're Coming:
- **HTML** and **CSS**: Yeah, I can make stuff look pretty on the web now—who would've thought?
- **JavaScript**: Still figuring out how promises work. But hey, I’ll get there.
- **Ruby on Rails**: Just getting started, but I’m ready to build apps that don't crash (most of the time).

### 🧗‍♂️ Current Challenge:
Taking on projects from **The Odin Project** and embracing the learning grind, one "Aha!" moment at a time. If you see a weird commit, it’s probably me trying to figure out how code works.

### 🎯 Goals:
- *Become a RoR Developer:* Yep, Rails is the dream, and I'm putting in the work to get there.
- *Break into Tech:* Eventually, I'll be writing code that powers something cool—or at least doesn't break immediately.
- *Sarcasm:* Keep that sarcasm going strong. It keeps me sane.

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Fun Facts:
- I'm 30 years old and the proud dad of a little princess named Catarina. 👑
- Happily married to my amazing wife Renata. Life's a wild ride, but we’re surviving and thriving!
